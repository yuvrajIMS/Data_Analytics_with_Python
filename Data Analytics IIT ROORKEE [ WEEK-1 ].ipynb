    "1. Variable - is a characteristics of any entity being studied that is capable of taking different values.\n",
    "2. Measurements - is when a standard process is used to assign numbers to particular attributes or characteristics of a variable.\n",
    "3. Data - data are recorded measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Analytics - It is a scientific process for transforming data into insights for making better decisions. In other words, it use of data, information technology, statistical analysis, quantitive methods, and mathematical or computer-based model to help managers gain improved insight about their business operations and make better, fact-based decisions - James Evans. It is the process of examining, transforming, and arranging raw data in a specific way to generate useful information from it. it allows for the evaluation of data through analytics and logical reasoning to lead to some sort of outcome or conclusion in some context. It is multi-faceted process that involves a number of steps, approached, and diverse techniques. \n",

    "helps to forecast trends.Predicting the probability of an event happening in future or estimating the accurate time it will happen can all be determined with help of the predictive analytical models. Many different but co-dependent variables are analysed to predict a trend in this type of analysis. E.x. Linear regression, time series analysis and forecasting and data mining. \n",
